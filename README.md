# Conway's Game of Life

This website was made by following this tutorial in order for me to learn about rust and web assembly.
https://rustwasm.github.io/book/introduction.html

## How it works

The program is written in Rust and compiled using wasm-pack into a .wasm (web assembly) file. This is then ran within a normal JavaScript based website where values can be passed through memory between the JS elements and assembly.

## Why Rust?

Rust is known for having blazingly fast performance therefore for web apps that require high computation, a solution like rust and wasm are very beneficial.
